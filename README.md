 Number Guessing Game is a 2D game base on the Python library "pygame". The goal of the game is for the player to guess a randomly generated number. The player has a limited amount of attempts to guess the number based on the dificulty selected in the begining of the game. In the begining of the game the player can also rescale the game window. After selecting dificulty the main game screen apears. The player must type a number between 0 and 100. Then they can either press the "guess" button or press "enter" on their keyboard to make his guess. If the random number is higher then the players guess the game displays "higher".
